        <h4>Static profiles are very useful for harvesting, interacting and experimenting with your crops. For construction and general lighting purposes. And, when using D9NX3 with external timers.</h4>

                      <div class="tab-pane active" id="static_br66">
                        This profile sets D9NX3 to 66% Blue+Red and 33% Green, always on.
                        <br/>
                        <br/> This is similar to a standard grow lamp's spectrum output when using HPS or "Blue Veg" LEDs.
                        <br/>
                        <br/> This mode is particularly well suited to stimulate a reasonable amount of Vegetative growth while not completely tilting the balance towards it, or, to germinate new seedlings.
                        <br/>
                      </div>
                      <div class="tab-pane" id="static_br75">
                        This profile sets D9NX3 to 75% Blue+Red and 33% Green, always on.
                        <br/>
                        <br/> With even less Green and more Blue+Red, this mode simulates an HPS light while far outperforming it on uMol/Watt, Growth per day and thermal limits.
                        <br/>
                        <br/> This mode is particularly well suited to boost young plants into a very rapid vegetative growth cycle - it will result in taller, skinnier plants than those grown with more Green.
                        <br/>
                      </div>
                      <div class="tab-pane" id="static_br50">
                        This profile sets D9NX3 to 50% Blue and 50% Red, always on.
                        <br/>
                        <br/> This is the closest mode to a "standard" grow lamp: The Green channel is disabled and D9NX3 only outputs a full mixture of Blue and Red.
                        <br/>
                        <br/> This mode boosts both plant metabolisms (Vegetative and Blooming) once plants are established and of good size.
                        <br/>
                      </div>
                      <div class="tab-pane" id="static_harvest">
                        This profile sets D9NX3 to White generated by equal amounts of R,G,B.
                        <br/>
                        <br/> This mode easily allows Growers to interact with their crops: it provides a comfortable shade of white for our eyes.
                        <br/>
                        <br/> "Harvest" Mode is the closest mode to a standard, white LED light.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                      </div>
                      <div class="tab-pane" id="static_colour">
                        Each of these three profiles sets the output to any one colour.
                        <br/>
                        <br/> This mode lets you experiment with your plants and your growing conditions, and is is provided as a starting point for you to measure and adjust DLI per colour.
                        <br/>
                        <br/> And you can always throw parties after the harvests you will have with D9NX3 afterwards
